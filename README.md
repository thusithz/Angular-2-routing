# Angular-2-routing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Setting up the project

Download the exercise source code from Github. 

Get a command prompt in the project folder and run command �npm install�. 
This will install all the external libraries required including angular 2 modules. 
You need to have the internet connection when you run �npm install�.

Once you have successfully downloaded the external modules you can see there are two new folders created in your project folder called �node_modules� and �typings�. 
Note - If the �typings� folder doesn't show up after running npm install, you'll need to install it manually with the command �npm run typings install�

#Running the application

Get a command prompt in the project folder and run command �npm start� to start the application.
